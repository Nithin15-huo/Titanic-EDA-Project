# Titanic EDA Project

##  Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover survival patterns and understand the key factors that influenced passenger survival.

Using Python-based data analysis and visualization tools, this project explores relationships between features such as gender, passenger class, age, fare, and survival status.

---

##  Objectives

- Analyze overall survival distribution  
- Compare survival rates by gender  
- Study the impact of passenger class (Pclass)  
- Examine age distribution and its effect on survival  
- Analyze fare distribution  
- Identify correlations between features  
- Handle missing values effectively  

---

##  Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about Titanic passengers, including:

- PassengerId  
- Pclass (Ticket class)  
- Name  
- Sex  
- Age  
- SibSp (Siblings/Spouses aboard)  
- Parch (Parents/Children aboard)  
- Fare  
- Embarked  
- Survived (Target Variable)  

---

##  Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Exploratory Data Analysis Performed

### 1. Survival Analysis
- Overall survival count
- Survival comparison between male and female passengers
- Survival comparison across passenger classes

### 2. Age Analysis
- Age distribution visualization
- Survival rate by age groups

### 3. Fare Analysis
- Fare distribution
- Relationship between fare and survival

### 4. Missing Value Handling
- Identified missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked
- Applied appropriate data cleaning techniques

### 5. Correlation Analysis
- Heatmap of feature correlations
- Identified features strongly associated with survival

---

##  Key Insights

- Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate than male passengers.
- Passengers in 1st class had better survival chances compared to 2nd and 3rd class.
- Higher ticket fares were associated with higher survival probability.
- Children showed relatively better survival rates.
- Socioeconomic status played a major role in survival outcomes.
